    <section>
      
    <h2>RSP Data model</h2>
      
    <h3>Temporal entities</h3>
    
    <p>Let T denote the set of temporal entities. This specification is neutral regarding the formal specification of temporal entities.</p>
    
    <h4>Instants and Intervals</h4>
    
    <p>Following the concepts of the Time Ontology (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/">http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/</a>), a temporal entity can be a time instant or a time interval.</p>
    
    <h3>Timestamped graph</h3>
    
    <p>A <em>timestamped graph</em> is defined as an RDF Dataset under the RDF Dataset semantics that <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-rdf11-datasets-20140225/#each-named-graph-defines-its-own-context">each graph defines its own context</a> with the following constraints.</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>There is a single named graph pair (n, g) in the RDF Dataset (where <code>g</code> is an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-rdf-graph">RDF graph</a>, and <code>n</code> is an IRI or blank node).</li>
      <li>There is a <del>single</del> triple in the default graph of the RDF Dataset, and it has the form (n, p, t), where <code>n</code> is defined in the previous item, <code>p</code> is a predicate that captures the relationship between the temporal entity <code>t</code>, called the timestamp, and the graph <code>g</code>.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Limitations of the definition:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>does <strong>not</strong> allow the default graph of a timestamped graph to have more than triple.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Discussion:</strong> There could be multiple timestamps associated with a graph <code>g</code>, e.g. a start time and an end time, or a generated time and a system processing time. The predicate <code>p</code> should be drawn from a community agreed vocabulary (<a href="https://github.com/streamreasoning/RSP-QL/issues/10">Issue 10</a>).</p>
      
      <p><strong>Discussion:</strong> More than one triple may be necessary to represent the time metadata for each graph.</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    
    <p>The following timestamped graph <code>:g1</code> contains 2 triples that state that Darko and Axel are in the Red Room. The <code>p</code> predicate used in this example is the PROV `<code>prov:generatedAtTime</code>. In this example the named graph <code>:g1</code> contains the data contents (triples). The format in the example follows <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/trig/">TriG</a>, although does not imply any specific serialization or formatting, it simply shows the data structured according to the RDF stream model. Prefixes (e.g. <code>prov:</code>) are used for readability.</p>
    
      <pre class="example highlight" title="Timestamped Graph with IRI Graph Name and Quads"><code>:g1 {:axel :isIn :RedRoom. :darko :isIn :RedRoom} {:g1,prov:generatedAtTime,"2001-10-26T21:32:52Z"}
</code></pre>
    
    <h3>RDF Stream</h3>
    
    <p>A <em>RDF stream</em> <code>S</code> consists of a sequence of timestamped graphs whose elements sharing the same predicate are ordered by the partial order associated with this predicate on the timestamps. </p>
    
    <p><strong>Order:</strong> The partial order must respect the natural order of time. In particular, if every time instant within the closure of temporal entity <code>X</code> is earlier than every time instant within the closure of temporal entity <code>Y</code>, then <code>X &lt;= Y</code> (where closure of a time instant <code>t</code> is defined as the degenerate interval <code>[t, t]</code>, and closure of an interval is defined in the usual way) </p>
    
    <p>Furthermore, the usual mathematical requirements of a partial order apply:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>a) Reflexivity <code>X &lt;= X</code></li>
      <li>b) Antisymmetry <code>X &lt;= Y</code> and <code>Y &lt;= X</code> implies <code>X = Y</code></li>
      <li>c) Transitivity <code>X &lt;= Y</code> and <code>Y &lt;= Z</code> implies <code>X &lt;= Z</code>. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>On the following we may refer to RDF stream simply as stream.</p>
    
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    
    <p>A stream produces data that indicates where a person is at a given time. The <code>p</code> predicate used in this example is the PROV `<code>prov:generatedAtTime</code>. In this example the named graphs (<code>:g1</code>,<code>:g2</code>, etc.) contain the streaming data contents (for brevity the contents are represented by the dots <code>...</code>). </p>
    
    <pre  class="example highlight" title="RDF Stream Abbreviated"><code>:g1 {...}{:g1,prov:generatedAtTime,t1}
:g2 {...}{:g2,prov:generatedAtTime,t2}
:g3 {...}{:g3,prov:generatedAtTime,t3}
:g4 {...}{:g4,prov:generatedAtTime,t4}
...
</code></pre>
    
    <p>We can expand the content of each named graph, which is a set of triples:</p>
    
    <pre  class="example highlight" title="RDF Stream Expanded"><code>:g1 {:axel :isIn :RedRoom. :darko :isIn :RedRoom} {:g1,prov:generatedAtTime,t1}
:g2 {:axel :isIn :BlueRoom. }                     {:g2,prov:generatedAtTime,t2}
:g3 {:minh :isIn :RedRoom. }                      {:g3,prov:generatedAtTime,t3}
...
</code></pre>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Discussion</strong>: Given a certain <code>p</code>, elements on the stream having that predicate are ordered according to <code>t</code>. If the stream contains elements s1 and s2 associated with the same predicate, with s1 preceding s2, then it should not be the case that the timestamp of s1 is greater than the timestamp of s2.</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p><strong>Observation:</strong> There can be multiple graphs with the same timestamp in the stream.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>It has been pointed out that this statement might be problematic, as graphs cold no longer be used for punctuation purposes. Comparatively, we have not found a constraint on this in similar models e.g. CQL: <em>there could be zero, one, or multiple elements with the same timestamp in a stream</em>. To verify.</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <h3>Substream</h3>
    
    <p>A <em>substream</em> (also known as window) <code>S'</code> of an RDF stream <code>S</code> is an RDF stream that is a subsequence of <code>S</code>.</p>

      <h2>RDF Stream Subclasses</h2>
      
      <p class="ednote">This section previously contained definitions for concepts called time-bounded substreams and count-bounded substreams.
      Those concepts are not defined in this draft, and instead we include some RDF stream subclasses defined by certain constraining properties.
      This section may be expanded with more subclasses if a need is identified.</p>
    
    <h3>Time-bounded RDF Stream</h3>
    
      <p>A <em>time-bounded RDF stream</em> is an RDF Stream where for every timestamp predicate that occurs in the stream, there is a temporal entity in its range that bounds (is greater than or equal to) all timestamps of that predicate in the stream.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p  class="ednote">
          Consider the class of timestamp predicates whose associated poset of temporal entities is <emph>pairwise bounded</emph>, i.e. has the property that every pair of temporal entities is bounded, i.e. there exists a temporal entity in the poset that is greater or equal to both of them.
          (This is a fairly natural property to expect for partial orders on timescales.)
          The class of RDF streams using only such timestamp predicates is closed under stream merger and union.
          <br/><br/>
          Thus it would be reasonable to require this property for the partial order associated with timestamp predicates. If so, we would be able to claim the following:
          <br/><br/>
          The class of time-bounded RDF streams is closed under stream merger and union.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p  class="note">
          The class of time-bounded RDF streams using timestamp predicates with well-ordered sets of temporal entities is closed under stream merger and union.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <h3>Count-bounded RDF Stream</h3>
      
      <p>A <em>count-bounded RDF stream</em> is an RDF stream where for each timestamp predicate that occurs in the stream, there are a finite number of temporal entities that are timestamps for that predicate.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p  class="ednote">
          Given an RDF stream whose set of timestamp predicates with pair-wise bounded temporal entities, then if the stream is count-bounded it is also time-bounded, since the upper bound for each predicate can be taken as an upper bound of the (finite) set of its timestamps.
          <br/><br/>
          Again, this suggests it would be a good idea to require this property for all timestamp predicates. If so, we would be able to claim the following:
          <br/><br/>
          Every count-bounded RDF stream is time-bounded.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p  class="note">
          Every count-bounded RDF stream using only timestamp predicates with well-ordered sets of temporal entities is time-bounded.
        </p>

        <p  class="note">
          The class of count-bounded RDF streams is closed under stream merger and union.

        </pre>
      </blockquote>
      
    <h3>Finite RDF Stream</h3>
    
      <p>A <em>finite RDF stream</em> is an RDF stream with a finite number of items in it.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p  class="note">
          Every finite RDF stream is count-bounded and time-bounded.

    <h2>Window Functions</h2>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p  class="note">Window operator is reserved for later use to return time-varying graphs. Window functions work on a time instant. </p>
      
      <p class="note">In the following, we take the case where temporal entities in the stream are time instants.</p>
      
      <p>Open Issue: <a href="https://github.com/streamreasoning/RSP-QL/issues/18">Issue 18</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>A <em>window function</em> <code>w<sub>ι</sub></code> of type <code>ι</code> takes as input a stream <code>S</code>, a predicate <code>p</code>, a time instant <code>t</code>, called the reference time point, and a vector of window parameters <code>x</code> for type <code>ι</code> and returns a substream <code>S'</code> of <code>S</code> that contains only timestamped graphs associated with <code>p</code> and timestamps valid at <code>t</code> according <code>ι</code> and <code>x</code>.</p>
    
    <p>The most common types of windows in practice are time-based and count-based. We associate them with the window functions <code>w<sub>τ</sub></code>, <code>w<sub>#</sub></code>, respectively. They take a fixed size ranging back in time from a reference time point <code>t</code>. These functions work as follows.</p>
    
    <h3>Time-based window functions</h3>
    
    <p><code>x = (l,d)</code>, where <code>l ∈ N ∪ {∞}</code> and <code>d ∈ N</code>. The function <code>w<sub>τ</sub>(S,p,t,x)</code> returns the substream of S that contains all timestamped graphs associated with predicate <code>p</code> of the last <code>l</code> time units relative to a pivot time point <code>t'</code> derived from <code>t</code> and the step size <code>d</code> (Todo: MD: a figure to illustrate). We use <code>l = ∞</code> to take all previous timestamped graphs.</p>
    
    <p>Formally:</p>
    
    <p><code>w<sub>τ</sub>(S,p,t,(l,d)) = {((n,g),p,t<sub>1</sub>)∈ S ∣ t'-l &lt; t<sub>1</sub> ≤ t'}</code>, </p>
    
    <p>where <code>t'= ⌊t/d⌋ \cdot d</code></p>
    
    <h3>Count-based window functions</h3>
    
    <p><code>x = (l)</code>, where <code>l ∈ N</code>. The function <code>w<sub>#</sub>(S,p,t,x)</code> selects a substream <code>S<sub>1</sub></code> of <code>S</code> based on the time instant <code>t'</code> satisfying that:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>for every <code>t' &lt; t'' ≤ t</code>, there are fewer than <code>l</code> timestamped graphs associated with predicate <code>p</code> in <code>S</code> from <code>t''</code> to <code>t</code>,</li>
      <li>there are at least <code>l</code> timestamped graphs associated with predicate <code>p</code> in <code>S</code> from <code>t'</code> to <code>t</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Elements from <code>S<sub>1</sub></code> are those <code>((n<sub>i</sub>,g<sub>i</sub>),p,t<sub>i</sub>)</code> from <code>S</code> having <code>t<sub>i</sub> ≥ t'</code>. In case there are more than <code>l</code> timestamped graphs associated with predicate <code>p</code> in <code>S</code> from <code>t'</code> to <code>t</code>, only timestamped graphs at <code>t'</code> are removed at random.</p>
    
    <p>Formally:</p>
    
    <p><code>w<sub>#</sub>(S,p,t,(l)) = {((n,g),p,t'') ∈ S ∣ t' &lt; t'' ≤ t} ∪ X(S|<sub>p</sub>[t',t'], l - #S|<sub>p</sub>[t'+1,t])</code>,</p>
    
    <p>where</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><code>S|<sub>p</sub>[t<sub>1</sub>,t<sub>2</sub>] = {((n,g),p,t'') ∈ S ∣ t<sub>1</sub> ≤ t'' ≤ t<sub>2</sub>}</code>,</li>
      <li><code>#S|<sub>p</sub>[t<sub>1</sub>,t<sub>2</sub>]</code> is the number of elements of this set,</li>
      <li><code>t'</code> satisfies that <code>#S|<sub>p</sub>[t',t] ≥ l</code> and <code>#S|<sub>p</sub>[t'+1,t] &lt; l</code> </li>

      <h3>Beyond time instants: intervals &amp; more</h3>
      
      <p>Usign the previously described model, intervals can be specified for a graph in the following way: Given p1 and p2 representing start and end time predicates, then <code>(g,p1,t1)</code> and <code>(g,p2,t2)</code> denote that g is defined in an interval [t1,t2]. As an example:</p>
      
      <pre  class="example highlight" title="RDF Stream with Two Timestamp Predicates for One Named Graph"><code>:g_1, :startsAt, "2015-06-18T12:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime
:g_1, :endsAt, "2015-06-18T13:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime
</code></pre>
      
      <p>Or even:</p>
      
      <pre  class="example highlight" title="RDF Stream with Interval Timestamp"><code>:g_2 :validBetween
    [:startsAt "2015-06-18T12:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime;
    :endsAt "2015-06-18T13:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime]
