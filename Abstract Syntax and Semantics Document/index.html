    <h2>RSP Data model</h2>
      
    <h3>Temporal entities</h3>
    
    <p>Let T denote the set of temporal entities. This specification is neutral regarding the formal specification of temporal entities.</p>
    
    <h4>Instants and Intervals</h4>
    
    <p>Following the concepts of the Time Ontology (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/">http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/</a>), a temporal entity can be a time instant or a time interval.</p>
    <section id="def-timestamped-graph">
    <h3>Timestamped graph</h3>
    
      <p>A <em>timestamped graph</em> is defined as an RDF Dataset under the RDF Dataset semantics that <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-rdf11-datasets-20140225/#each-named-graph-defines-its-own-context">each graph defines its own context</a> and where a particular triple in the default graph has been designated as the timestamp triple, with the following constraints.</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>There is exactly one named graph pair <code>&lt;n, G></code> in the RDF Dataset (where <code>G</code> is an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-rdf-graph">RDF graph</a>, and <code>n</code> is an IRI or blank node).</li>
      <li>The timestamp triple has the form <code>&lt;n, p, t></code>, where <code>n</code> is defined in the previous item, <code>p</code> is a timestamp predicate that captures the relationship between the temporal entity <code>t</code>, called the timestamp, and the graph <code>G</code>.</li>
    </ol>
      <p class="note">There may be multiple triples in the default graph, including multiple triples using timestamp predicates, 
        but exactly one triple must be designated as the timestamp triple.</p>
    
    <p class="ednote">This definition does not permit the timestamp to be omitted, which is one of the data structures
      that is considered to be in-scope by the requirements document.
    </p>
      <p class="note">
      This definition allows the timestamp to be implicit.
      For example, the timestamp predicate could be an IRI or blank node rather than a literal.
    </p>
      
      <p class="note">An <em>explicitly</em> timestamped graph is a timestamped graph whose timestamp <code>t</code> is a literal.</p>
      
      <p class="ednote">Merge and union of equivalence classes of streams with implicitly timestamped graphs may not be defined. See <a href="#merge-union"></a>.</p>
          
      <p class="ednote">The timestamp predicate <code>p</code> may be drawn from a community agreed 
        vocabulary (<a href="https://github.com/streamreasoning/RSP-QL/issues/10">Issue 10</a>).
        The timestamp predicate may also be user-defined.
      </p>
          
    <aside class="example highlight" title="Explicitly Timestamped Graph">
    
      <p>The following timestamped graph contains a named graph <code>&lt;:g, G></code> where the graph <code>G</code> contains 2 triples that state that Darko and Axel are in the Red Room. The timestampe predicate <code>p</code> used in this example is the PROV `<code>prov:generatedAtTime</code>.
        The format in the example follows <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/trig/">TriG</a>, although does not imply any specific serialization or formatting; 
        it simply shows the data structured according to the RDF stream model.  
        The default graph contains only the timestamp triple, so there is no need of an additional format to designate it. 
        In examples of timestamped graphs having more than one triple in the default graph, the first triple of the default graph to occur in the serialization
        is the timestamp triple.
        Prefixes (e.g. <code>prov:</code>) are used, without explicitly defining their expansion, for readability.</p>
    
      <pre><code>:g1 {:axel :isIn :RedRoom. :darko :isIn :RedRoom} {:g1,prov:generatedAtTime,"2001-10-26T21:32:52Z"}
</code></pre>
    </aside>
      <p class="ednote">A subsection should be created to hold all the information about the formatting of examples, and here
      the expansion of the prefixes can be defined.</p>
    </section>
    
    <h3>RDF Stream</h3>
    
      <p>An <em>RDF stream</em> <code>S</code> consists of a sequence of timestamped graphs whose elements sharing the same predicate are ordered by the partial order associated with this predicate on the timestamps. I.e., if a stream <code>S</code> contains elements <code>S(i)</code> and <code>S(j)</code> with <code>i &lt; j</code> whose timestamp triples contain the same timestamp predicate <code>p</code>, then it should not be the case that the timestamp of <code>S(i)</code> is greater than the timestamp of <code>S(j)</code>. </p>
    
    <p><strong>Order:</strong> The partial order MUST respect the natural order of time. In particular, if every time instant within the closure of temporal entity <code>X</code> is earlier than every time instant within the closure of temporal entity <code>Y</code>, then <code>X &lt;= Y</code> (where closure of a time instant <code>t</code> is defined as the degenerate interval <code>[t, t]</code>, and closure of an interval is defined in the usual way) </p>
    
    <p>Furthermore, the usual mathematical requirements of a partial order apply:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>a) Reflexivity <code>X &lt;= X</code></li>
      <li>b) Antisymmetry <code>X &lt;= Y</code> and <code>Y &lt;= X</code> implies <code>X = Y</code></li>
      <li>c) Transitivity <code>X &lt;= Y</code> and <code>Y &lt;= Z</code> implies <code>X &lt;= Z</code>. </li>
    </ul>
      
      <p class="ednote">Time-boundedness properties on RDF streams behave better if it is required that the set of temporal entities for each timestamp predicate is pairwise bounded. I.e., for each pair of temporal entities in the set, there is a temporal entity in the set that is an upper bound of both, as well as a temporal entity in the set that is a lower bound of both.</p>
      
    <p class="ednote">The comparability between any pair of elements of an RDF stream must be completely determined
      from the default graphs of the elements.
    Otherwise the ordering could be revealed by a subsequent element, inducing retroactively an
    ordering requirement on previous stream elements.</p>
    
    <p>On the following we may refer to RDF stream simply as stream.</p>
    
    <aside class="example highlight" title="RDF Stream">
    
    <p>An RDF stream produces data that indicates where a person is at a given time. The timestamp predicate <code>p</code> used in this example is the PROV `<code>prov:generatedAtTime</code>. In this example the named graphs (<code>:g1</code>,<code>:g2</code>, etc.) contain the streaming data contents (for brevity the contents are represented by the dots <code>...</code>). </p>
    
    <pre  class="example highlight" title="RDF Stream Abbreviated"><code>:g1 {...}{:g1,prov:generatedAtTime,t1}
:g2 {...} {:g2, prov:generatedAtTime, t2}
:g3 {...} {:g3, prov:generatedAtTime, t3}
:g4 {...} {:g4, prov:generatedAtTime, t4}
...
</code></pre>
    
    <p>We can expand the content of each named graph, which is a set of triples:</p>
    
    <pre  class="example highlight" title="RDF Stream Expanded"><code>
:g1 {:axel :isIn :RedRoom. :darko :isIn :RedRoom} {:g1, prov:generatedAtTime, t1}
:g2 {:axel :isIn :BlueRoom. }                     {:g2, prov:generatedAtTime, t2}
:g3 {:minh :isIn :RedRoom. }                      {:g3, prov:generatedAtTime, t3}
...
</code></pre>
      </p>
    </aside>
    
    <p class="note">There can be multiple graphs with the same timestamp in the stream.</p>
    
      <p class="ednote">It has been pointed out that this statement might be problematic, as graphs cold no longer be used for punctuation purposes. Comparatively, we have not found a constraint on this in similar models e.g. CQL: <em>there could be zero, one, or multiple elements with the same timestamp in a stream</em>.</p>
    
    <h3>Substream</h3>
    
    <p>A <em>substream</em> (also known as window) <code>S'</code> of a stream <code>S</code> is a subsequence of <code>S</code>.</p>
    
    <h4>Time-bounded Substream</h4>
    
    <p>A <em>time-bounded substream</em> is defined by two time instances providing a lower bound <code>t_l</code> and an upper bound <code>t_u</code> where <code>t_l &lt;= t_u</code>. A timestamped graph <code>(g_i,p_i,t_i)</code> is in the time-bounded substream if and only if <code>t_l &lt;= t_i &lt;= t_u</code>.</p>
    
    <h4>Count-bounded Substream</h4>
    
    <p>A <em>count-bounded substream</em> is defined by a time instance <code>t</code> and an integer value <code>n</code> that represents the number of timestamped graphs to include in the count-bounded substream. The count-bounded substream consists of the <code>n</code> timestamped graphs at or before time instance <code>t</code>. That is, a timestamped graph <code>(g_i,p_i,t_i)</code> is in the count-bounded substream if and only if there are less than or equal to <code>n</code> timestamped graphs between it and the time instance <code>t</code>.</p>
    
    <p  class="note">A bounded substream maintains the timestamped graph contexts of the original stream.</p>

      <p  class="note">Window operator is reserved for later use to return time-varying graphs. Window functions work on a time instant. </p>
      
      <p class="note">In the following, we take the case where temporal entities in the stream are time instants.</p>
      
      <p>Open Issue: <a href="https://github.com/streamreasoning/RSP-QL/issues/18">Issue 18</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>A <em>window function</em> <code>w<sub>ι</sub></code> of type <code>ι</code> takes as input a stream <code>S</code>, a predicate <code>p</code>, a time instant <code>t</code>, called the reference time point, and a vector of window parameters <code>x</code> for type <code>ι</code> and returns a substream <code>S'</code> of <code>S</code> that contains only timestamped graphs associated with <code>p</code> and timestamps valid at <code>t</code> according <code>ι</code> and <code>x</code>.</p>
    
    <p>The most common types of windows in practice are time-based and count-based. We associate them with the window functions <code>w<sub>τ</sub></code>, <code>w<sub>#</sub></code>, respectively. They take a fixed size ranging back in time from a reference time point <code>t</code>. These functions work as follows.</p>
    
    <h3>Time-based window functions</h3>
    
    <p><code>x = (l,d)</code>, where <code>l ∈ N ∪ {∞}</code> and <code>d ∈ N</code>. The function <code>w<sub>τ</sub>(S,p,t,x)</code> returns the substream of S that contains all timestamped graphs associated with predicate <code>p</code> of the last <code>l</code> time units relative to a pivot time point <code>t'</code> derived from <code>t</code> and the step size <code>d</code> (Todo: MD: a figure to illustrate). We use <code>l = ∞</code> to take all previous timestamped graphs.</p>
    
    <p>Formally:</p>
    
    <p><code>w<sub>τ</sub>(S,p,t,(l,d)) = {((n,g),p,t<sub>1</sub>)∈ S ∣ t'-l &lt; t<sub>1</sub> ≤ t'}</code>, </p>
    
    <p>where <code>t'= ⌊t/d⌋ \cdot d</code></p>
    
    <h3>Count-based window functions</h3>
    
    <p><code>x = (l)</code>, where <code>l ∈ N</code>. The function <code>w<sub>#</sub>(S,p,t,x)</code> selects a substream <code>S<sub>1</sub></code> of <code>S</code> based on the time instant <code>t'</code> satisfying that:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>for every <code>t' &lt; t'' ≤ t</code>, there are fewer than <code>l</code> timestamped graphs associated with predicate <code>p</code> in <code>S</code> from <code>t''</code> to <code>t</code>,</li>
      <li>there are at least <code>l</code> timestamped graphs associated with predicate <code>p</code> in <code>S</code> from <code>t'</code> to <code>t</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Elements from <code>S<sub>1</sub></code> are those <code>((n<sub>i</sub>,g<sub>i</sub>),p,t<sub>i</sub>)</code> from <code>S</code> having <code>t<sub>i</sub> ≥ t'</code>. In case there are more than <code>l</code> timestamped graphs associated with predicate <code>p</code> in <code>S</code> from <code>t'</code> to <code>t</code>, only timestamped graphs at <code>t'</code> are removed at random.</p>
    
    <p>Formally:</p>
    
    <p><code>w<sub>#</sub>(S,p,t,(l)) = {((n,g),p,t'') ∈ S ∣ t' &lt; t'' ≤ t} ∪ X(S|<sub>p</sub>[t',t'], l - #S|<sub>p</sub>[t'+1,t])</code>,</p>
    
    <p>where</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><code>S|<sub>p</sub>[t<sub>1</sub>,t<sub>2</sub>] = {((n,g),p,t'') ∈ S ∣ t<sub>1</sub> ≤ t'' ≤ t<sub>2</sub>}</code>,</li>
      <li><code>#S|<sub>p</sub>[t<sub>1</sub>,t<sub>2</sub>]</code> is the number of elements of this set,</li>
      <li><code>t'</code> satisfies that <code>#S|<sub>p</sub>[t',t] ≥ l</code> and <code>#S|<sub>p</sub>[t'+1,t] &lt; l</code> </li>

:g_1, :endsAt, "2015-06-18T13:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime
</code></pre>
      
      <p>Or even:</p>
      
      <pre  class="example highlight" title="RDF Stream with Interval Timestamp"><code>:g_2 :validBetween
    [:startsAt "2015-06-18T12:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime;
    :endsAt "2015-06-18T13:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime]
</code></pre>
