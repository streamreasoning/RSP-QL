          <h4>Class of Temporal Entities</h4>
          <p>Let T<sup>all</sup> denote the class of all temporal entities. This specification is
            neutral regarding the formal specification of temporal entities. </p>
          <p>We provide an identifier, <code>rsp:TemporalEntity</code>, for the <code>rdfs:Class</code> of all
            temporal entities.</p>
          <h5>Instants and Intervals</h5>
          <p class="ednote">The following material needs attention from an individual who has
            reviewed the literature regarding temporal ontologies, including but not limited to
            http://www.omg.org/spec/DTV/1.0/ http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/docs/timeCatalog.pdf

            There is more detail in https://github.com/streamreasoning/RSP-QL/issues/25</p>
          <p>An instant is an instantaneous point of time on underlying axis and is isomorphic to
            numbers. Henceforth a time interval is the interval between two instants. A
            semi-infinite time interval is an interval where one instant is set to infinite.
            Furthermore if both instants are set to infinite, we call the interval bi-infinite. As a
            consequence a temporal entity is an entity associated with an instant or a time
            interval[Dyreson94,Allen83]. </p>

            <p>An ontology that contains both the concept of instants and time intervals is the
              OWLTime ontology (see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/"></a>). It defines all
              necessary temporal RDF concepts, such as instants, intervals and temporalEntities, and

          <h4>Timestamp Predicates</h4>
          <p> An RSP timestamp predicate <code>P</code> is an <code>rdf:Property</code> with range <code>rsp:TemporalEntity</code> that is
            associated, through the <code>rdf:Property</code> <code>rsp:hasTimePlenum</code>, with a unique partially-ordered set (poset) of 
            temporal entities <code>T<sub>P</sub> &sube; T<sup>all</sup></code>, called the <em>time plenum</em> of the predicate.
            The time plenum is associated, through the <code>rdf:Property</code> <code>rsp:hasPartialOrder</code>, 
            with a unique partial order <code>&le;<sub>P</sub></code> that is in the class
            <code>rsp:ChronologicalPartialOrder</code>.</p>
          <p>The usual mathematical requirements of a partial order MUST be satisfied by an instance of 
            <code>rsp:ChronologicalPartialOrder</code>. In particular, for all instances <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code>, <code>Z</code> 
            of the time plenum, the following properties hold: 
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Reflexivity</dt>
            <dd><code>X &le;<sub>P</sub> X</code></li></dd>
            <dt>Antisymmetry<dt>
              <dd>  <code>X &le;<sub>P</sub> Y</code> and <code>Y &le;<sub>P</sub> X</code> implies <code>X =
                Y</code></dd>
            <dt>Transitivity</dt>
              <dd><code>X &le;<sub>P</sub> Y</code> and <code>Y &le;<sub>P</sub> Z</code> implies <code>X &le;<sub>P</sub>
                Z</code>. </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>Further, an instance of <code>rsp:ChronologicalPartialOrder</code> MUST respect the natural order of time.</p>
          <p>In
            particular, if every time instant within the closure of temporal entity <code>X</code>
            is earlier than every time instant within the closure of temporal entity <code>Y</code>,
            then <code>X &le;<sub>P</sub> Y</code> (where closure of a time instant <code>t</code> is defined as
            the degenerate interval <code>[t, t]</code>, and closure of an interval is defined in
            the usual way) </p>
          <p class="ednote">The above definition regarding natural order of time depends on the
            concept of time instant as the primitive of temporal entities that is universal amoung
            temporal ontologies and has a particular chronological order associated with them. 
            However, not all temporal
            ontologies have time instants as their primitives, e.g., OMG.
            Further, branching temporal ontologies have a different set of time primitives than linear ones.
            So this needs to be fixed.

      <section id="def-timestamped-graph">
        <h3>Timestamped Graphs</h3>
        <p>A <em>timestamped graph</em> is defined as an RDF Dataset under the RDF Dataset semantics
          that <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-rdf11-datasets-20140225/#each-named-graph-defines-its-own-context"
            >"each named graph defines its own context"</a> (see <a href="#semantics"></a>) and
          where a particular triple in the default graph has been designated as the timestamp
          triple, with the following constraints:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>There is exactly one named graph pair <code>&lt;n, G></code> in the RDF Dataset (where
              <code>G</code> is an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-rdf-graph"
              >RDF graph</a>, and <code>n</code> is an IRI or blank node).</li>
          <li>The timestamp triple has the form <code>&lt;n, p, t></code>, where <code>n</code> is
            defined in the previous item, and <code>p</code> is a timestamp predicate that captures
            the relationship between the temporal entity <code>t</code>, called the timestamp, and
            the graph <code>G</code>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note">There may be multiple triples in the default graph, including multiple
          triples using timestamp predicates, but exactly one triple must be designated as the
          timestamp triple. The objects of any triples that use a timestamp predicate but are not the 
          timestamp triple of the timestamped graph are not called timestamps.</p>
        <p class="ednote">Due to the assertion of the timestamp triple, the context referred to in
          "each named graph defines its own context" has a temporal aspect to it. Other aspects of
          this context may be asserted by additional triples in the default graph of the timestamped
          graph. Such triples are not required to have timestamp predicates, and thus may be about
          non-temporal aspects of the context, e.g., the authority or the sensor device. That is, we
          require the context to have a temporal aspect to it, but the context is not limited to
          temporal aspects. Thus, it would be misleading to call it a "temporal context". </p>
        <p class="ednote">The part of the definition above that points to RDF Dataset semantics
          really belongs in the semantics section, not in this definition, which should be purely
          syntax. We need additional informative text that gives the motivation for these
          definitions. </p>
        <p class="ednote">This definition does not permit the timestamp to be omitted, which is one
          of the data structures that is considered to be in-scope by the requirements document. </p>
        <p> A sequence of RDF graphs (or named graphs, or RDF datasets) MAY be physically received
          by an RSP engine, which MAY then create an RDF stream from it by adding timestamps, e.g.
          indicating the time of arrival. The original sequence is not itself an RDF stream. </p>
        <p class="note"> This definition allows the timestamp to be an IRI or blanknode. Additional
          information about the timestamp may be provided in the default graph (e.g., through
          properties in the OWL Time Ontology), but this is not required by the definition of
          timestamped graph. </p>
        <p>A <em>literal-timestamped graph</em> is a timestamped graph whose timestamp
            <code>t</code> is an <code>rdfs:Literal</code>.</p>
        <p class="note">Merge and union of RDF streams with non-literal-timestamped graphs may not
          be defined. See <a href="#merge-union"></a>.</p>
        <p class="ednote">The timestamp predicate <code>p</code> may be drawn from a community
          agreed vocabulary (<a href="https://github.com/streamreasoning/RSP-QL/issues/10">Issue
            10</a>). The timestamp predicate may also be user-defined. </p>
        <p> The format in the examples of this document follows <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/trig/"
            >TriG</a>, although does not imply any specific serialization or formatting; it simply
          shows the data structured according to the RDF stream model. When the default graph of a
          timestamped graph contains only one triple, this must be the timestamp triple, so there is
          no need of an additional format to designate it. In examples of timestamped graphs having
          more than one triple in the default graph, the first triple of the default graph to occur
          in the serialization is assumed to be the timestamp triple. Prefixes (e.g.
            <code>prov:</code>, <code>dul:</code>) are used for readability; their expansions are defined in 
          <a>Table 1</a>.</p>
        <p class="ednote">A non-normative subsection should be created to hold all the information
          about the formatting of examples, and there the expansion of all prefixes that are used in
          examples can be defined.</p>
        <aside class="example" id="literal-TSG" title="Literal-Timestamped Graph">
          <p>The following timestamped graph contains a named graph pair <code>&lt;:g1, G></code>
            where the graph <code>G</code> contains two triples that state that entities
              <code>:darko</code> and <code>:axel</code> are in the <code>:RedRoom</code>. The
            timestamp predicate <code>p</code> used in this example is the [[PROV-O]] property <a
              href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#generatedAtTime"

        Kripke frames), scenarios (planning usecase), or concurrent processes (process modelling).
        It would be a useful property if the class of time-bounded RDF streams were closed under
        stream merger and union, and this property would hold, under the current definition, in the
        case of pairwise-bounded time plenums, because we could find bounds for the temporal entities
        of each timestamp predicate by taking an upper bound of the pair of upper bounds from the
        two streams, and similarly for the lower bounds. However, the closure property does not hold
        in the case of a branching temporal topology under the above definition of time-bounded. To
        achieve the closure property, we would have to allow a number of "upper bounds" for each
        timestamp predicate, rather than requiring just one. For example, <br /><br /> Given two
        sets, A and B, of entities in a partial order, we say that A bounds B from above iff there
        is no element of B that is greater than any element of A, and for every element of B there
        is some element of A that is greater than or equal to it. <br /><br /> A
          <em>time-bounded-above RDF stream</em> is an RDF Stream where for every timestamp
        predicate of the stream, there is a set of temporal entities in its range that
        bounds from above all timestamps of that predicate in the stream. </p>
      <p class="note"> The class of time-bounded RDF streams using timestamp predicates with
        pairwise-bounded time plenums is closed under stream merger and union. </p>
      <h3>Temporal-count-bounded RDF Streams</h3>
      <p>A <em>temporal-count-bounded RDF stream</em> is an RDF stream where for each timestamp
        predicate of the stream, there are a finite number of temporal entities in the

        temporal entities that are being counted, not timestamped graphs.</p>
      <p class="ednote"> Given an RDF stream whose set of timestamp predicates with pairwise-bounded
        temporal entities, then if the stream is temporal-count-bounded it is also time-bounded,
        since the upper bound for each timestamp predicate can be taken as an upper bound of the
        (finite) set of its timestamps, and similarly for the lower bound. If the definition of
        "time-bounded" was changed as in the earlier Editor's Note, then every
        temporal-count-bounded RDF stream would be time-bounded. </p>

        and union, since the sets of temporal entities for each timestamp predicate in the resulting

        finite. </p>

      <p>A <em>window function</em> is a partial function from RDF streams to their windows that

        <p>Applications that require a substream with an exact number <code>N</code> of elements for
          a specified timestamp predicate might apply a temporal-count-based window function with
            <code>N</code> for the count of temporal entities, and then randomly discard extra
          elements, according to some criterion, e.g., extreme elements (maximal or minimal,
          depending on the orientation of the counting). However, this extra step causes the process
          to be nondeterministic, and hence does not correspond to a function. If elements are
          discarded in a nonrandom fashion, e.g., based on their order in the stream sequence, then
          this would be a function, but would not preserve isomorphism, and so would not be a window
          function. The issue of obtaining a window function that returns an exact number of
          elements (for a particular predicate) is handled in the next section, where we define the
          concept of window relation, and use it to define an element-count-based window relation.
          When restricted to certain kinds of RDF streams, element-count-based window relations are
          functional so element-count-based window functions can be defined on such subsets. This
          and similar considerations, of importance to implementations, motivate the <a

        <h3>Window Relations</h3>
        <p>A <em>window relation</em> is a binary relation on RDF streams (a relation having an
          extension which is a set of pairs of RDF streams) such that the second element in the pair
          is a window of the first element and preserves isomorphism. That is, if <code>&lt;S1,
            S2&gt;</code> is a member of the extension of a window relation <code>W</code>, and
            <code>S3</code> and <code>S4</code> are isomorphic to <code>S1</code> and
            <code>S2</code>, resp., then <code>&lt;S3, S4&gt;</code> is also a member of the
          extension of <code>W</code>. </p>
        <p>A <em>length-based window relation</em>
          <code>W</code> is a window relation specified by a set of streams
            <code>W<sub>S</sub></code>, a finite set <code>W<sub>P</sub></code> of timestamp
          predicates together with the following parameters for each timestamp predicate
            <code>p</code> in <code>W<sub>P</sub></code>: <ul>
            <li>a semi-infinite temporal interval <code>W<sub>J</sub>(P)</code> of timestamp
              predicate <code>P</code> (the interval of <code>P</code>);</li>
            <li>a temporal entity <code>W<sub>T</sub>(P)</code> which is the finite endpoint of
                  <code>W<sub>J</sub>(P)</code> (the temporal reference of <code>P</code>);</li>
            <li>a positive integer <code>W<sub>N</sub>(P)</code> (the length for
              <code>P</code>)</li>
          </ul> The extension of a length-based window relation is defined as follows: Let
            <code>S</code> be an RDF stream in <code>W<sub>S</sub></code> with window
            <code>S'</code>. Define <code>T(S, P, W)</code> to be the set of temporal entities that
          are timestamps for elements of <code>S</code> with timestamp predicate <code>P</code> and
          belong to <code>W<sub>J</sub>(P)</code>, and <code>T(S', P)</code> to be the set of
          temporal entities that are timestamps for elements of <code>S'</code> with timestamp
          predicate <code>P</code>. The pair <code>&lt;S, S'&gt;</code> is a member of the extension
          of <code>W</code> if and only if the cardinality of <code>T(S', P)</code> is equal to the
          minimum of <code>W<sub>N</sub>(P)</code> and the cardinality of the set <code>T(S, P,
            W)</code> and for each element <code>S'(i)</code> of <code>S'</code>
          <ul>
            <li>the timestamp predicate <code>P</code> of <code>S'(i)</code> is in
                  <code>W<sub>P</sub></code>, and</li>
            <li> the timestamp <code>t</code> of <code>S'(i)</code> is in
                <code>W<sub>J</sub>(P)</code>.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>A <em>length-based window function</em>
          <code>W</code> on domain <code>W<sub>S</sub></code> is a length-based window relation
          where any member <code>&lt;S, S'&gt;</code> of its extension are such that <code>S</code>
          is in <code>W<sub>S</sub></code> and <code>W</code> defines a total function on

        <p class="ednote">The names "element-count-bounded window relation" and "element-count-bounded window function"
        have been proposed, as a replacement of "length-bounded ...". This nomenclature depends on the adoption of

      <h2>Semantics</h2>
      <p> The semantics of a timestamped graph is defined in terms of its semantics as an RDF
        Dataset. In particular, the designation of a particular triple in the default graph as the
        timestamp triple has no effect on its semantics. </p>
      <p>The semantics of timestamped graphs, and consequently of RDF streams, is based on the
        semantics formalized in [[RDF11-Datasets]] in the case that each named graph defines its own
        context.</p>
      <p>The following terms are used in the sense of [[RDF11-MT]]: <em>entailment regime,
          E-interpretation, blank node, universe, named graph pair, RDF graph, E-entails, default
          graph</em>.</p>
      <p> An <em>RSP interpretation</em>
        <code>I</code> with respect to an entailment regime <code>E</code> is an E-interpretation
        extended to named graphs, timestamped graphs, RDF datasets, and RDF streams as follows: <ul>
          <li>given a mapping <code>A</code> from blank nodes to the universe <code>IR</code> and a
            named graph pair <code>ng</code> = <code>&lt;n, G></code>, <code>[I+A](ng)</code> is
            true if and only if <code>[I+A](n)</code> is an RDF graph that E-entails
            <code>G</code>;</li>
          <li>for a timestamped graph <code>TSG</code> = <code>&lt; ng, DG></code>, where
              <code>DG</code> is the default graph and <code>ng</code> is the named graph pair of
              <code>TSG</code>,and a mapping <code>A</code> from blank nodes to the universe
              <code>IR</code>, <code>[I+A](TSG)</code> is true if and only if <code>[I+A](DG)</code>
            is true and <code>[I+A](ng)</code> is true;</li>
          <li><code>I(TSG)</code> true if and only if there exisits a mapping <code>A</code> from
            blank nodes to the universe <code>IR</code> such that [I+A](TSG) is true.</li>
          <li>for an RDF dataset <code>D</code> = <code>&lt; DG, NG></code>, where <code>DG</code>
            is the default graph and <code>NG</code> is the set of named graph pairs of
              <code>D</code>, <code>I(D)</code> is true if there exists a mapping <code>A</code>
            from blank nodes to the universe <code>IR</code> such that <code>[I+A](DG)</code> is
            true and <code>[I+A](ng)</code> is true for every <code>ng</code> in
            <code>NG</code>;</li>
          <li><code>I(D)</code> is false otherwise.</li>
          <li>for an RDF stream <code>S</code>, I(S) is true if and only if if there exists a
            mapping <code>A</code> from blank nodes to the universe <code>IR</code> such that for
            every element <code>S(i)</code> of <code>S</code>, <code>i &ge; 1</code>,
              <code>[I+A](S(i))</code> is true.</li>
        </ul> We say that an RSP interpretation <code>I</code> E-satisfies a graph, named graph
        pair, timestamped graph, dataset, or stream <code>X</code> (or satisfies <code>A</code>
        w.r.t the E-entailment regime) when <code>I(X)</code> is true. </p>
      <p>Following standard terminology, we say that a graph, named graph, timestamped graph,
        dataset, or stream <code>X</code> RSP-E-entails a graph, named graph, timestamped graph,
        dataset, or stream <code>Y</code> if and only if for every RSP interpretation <code>I</code>
        with respect to E-entailment, <code>I</code> E-satisfies <code>Y</code> whenever
          <code>I</code> E-satisfies <code>X</code>.</p>
      <p class="note">The "RSP" prefix in "RSP-E-entails" may be dropped when neither antecedent nor
        consequent is an RDF dataset or named graph, as in that case there is no possibility of
        alternate dataset semantics.</p>
      <p class="ednote">It should be straightforward to prove that isomorphic RDF streams simply
        entail each other, and hence are logically equivalent under simple entailment. This should
        also hold for other standard entailment regimes, and perhaps should be required for all RSP
        entailment regimes.</p>
      <p class="ednote"> The notion of RSP-E-entailment is defined here so that it may be used to
        support the definition of query semantics under various entailment regimes in the [[RSP-QL
        Queries]] document, including simple entailment. A choice was made regarding the semantics
        of named graph pairs (i.e., <code>[I+A](ng)</code> is true if and only if
          <code>[I+A](n)</code> is an RDF graph that E-entails <code>G</code>) that affects the
        semantics of timestamped graphs, datasets, and streams. It remains to be seen if this choice
        supports query semantics in a manner that meets the needs of the RSP-QL community. In
        particular, it imposes constraints on the denotation of the name of a named graph pair which
        may be inconsistent with the domain of a predicate that might be considered for use as a
        timestamp predicate (e.g., SSN predicate <code>ssn:observationSamplingTime</code>). </p>

          timestamp values: <ul>
            <li>RDF time series</li>
            <li>RDF distinct time series</li>
            <li>RDF regular time series</li>
            <li>RDF distinct regular time series</li>
          </ul></p>

          <h4>RDF Time-Series Profile</h4>
          <p>The RDF Stream Time-Series profile is designed to support high-volume, low-latency
            window operations and queries that depend on full knowledge of timestamps.</p>
          <p class="ednote">This motivational paragraph needs some work - the above is a place
            holder.</p>
          <p>An <em>RDF time series</em> is an RDF stream that satisfies the following
            properties:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The stream uses exactly one timestamp predicate.</li>
            <li>The range of this timestamp predicate is xsd:dateTimeStamp.</li>
            <li>No two elements in the time series have the same graph name.</li>
          </ol>
          <aside class="example">
            <p><a href="#literal-rdf-stream">Example 4</a> satisfies the first and third
              requirements of the time-series profile. However, the range of the predicate
                <code>prov:generatedAtTime</code> is not limited to xsd:dateTimeStamp -
              non-timezoned values of xsd:dateTime are also permitted.</p>
          </aside>
          <p class="ednote">If some property (e.g., in the RSP-QL namespace) is defined as a
            subproperty of <code>prov:generatedAtTime</code>, then this can be substituted in <a
              href="#literal-rdf-stream">Example 4</a>, which will then serve as an example of a
            time series. Alternatively, the definition could be changed so that the only requirement
            is that the timestamps that occur in the stream belong to xsd:dateTime. </p>
          <p class="note">The set of RDF time series is closed under RDF stream merge and union on
            time series that use the same timestamp predicate.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="distinct-time-series-profile">
          <h4>RDF Distinct Time-Series Profile</h4>
          <p>An "RDF distinct time series" is an RDF time series such that no two elements in the
            time series have the same timestamp.</p>
          <aside class="example">
            <p> A distinct time series example ...</p>
          </aside>
          <p class="note">An RDF distinct time series has a unique sequential order - it is
            S-isomorphic only to itself.</p>
          <p class="note">The merge or union of RDF distinct time series is always defined but is
            not necessarily an RDF distinct time series, even if the operation is restricted to time
            series that use the same timestamp predicate, due to the possibility of duplication of
            timestamp. However, the merge or union of RDF distinct time series that use the same
            timestamp predicate is always an RDF time series. </p>
          <p class="note">The restriction of element-count-based window relations 
            to distinct time series results in functional
            relations. This enables the definition of element-count-based window functions for distinct time series. 
            Further, the element-count-based window functions are always computable. However, the
            time-based window functions are not necessarily computable unless there is a finite
            precision to the timestamps, as can be seen from the Zeno's paradox example @@@(this
            example hasn't been written up yet, but is mentioned elsewhere). </p>
          <p class="ednote">There is going to be a lot more to talk about for RDF time series
            relative to queries, but in this document we don't have those definitions.</p>

        <section id="regular-time-series-profile">
          <h4>RDF Regular Time-Series Profile</h4> A <em>regular</em> RDF time series is a further
          subclass of distinct time series where the duration between timestamps is an integer
          multiple of a specified duration, called the <em>spacing</em> of the time series. <aside
            class="example">
            <p> A regular time series example ...</p>
          </aside>
          <p class="note"> The restriction of timestamps in the regular time series profile allows
            the timestamp to be represented concisely as an integer, provided the spacing is
            provided elsewhere, e.g., in metadata. </p>

          <h4>RDF Distinct Regular Time-Series Profile</h4> A <em>distinct regular</em> RDF time
          series is a further subclass of distinct time series that is both a distinct time series

      <aside class="ednote"><p>In order to indicate which profile applies to a stream, the
          transmission must include that information in addition to the stream content. For streams
          which are delivered the method is to supply the profile as a <code>profile</code>
          parameter to the media type. The following profiles are defined <ul>
