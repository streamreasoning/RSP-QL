    <section class="informative">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>Data streams are one of the main sources of information in a wide range of domains and applications, 
         and it is needed to make these streams available at Web scale. 
         For this to become a reality, we need to define Web standards and guidelines on how to produce and consume structured data streams. 
         <acronym title="RDF">RDF</acronym> ([[!RDF11-primer]]) is a <acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> recommendation 
         for structuring and representing data on the Web. 
         However, this model is based on a traditional persisted-data paradigm, where the focus is on maintaining a bounded set of data elements 
         in a knowledge base. This paradigm does not fit the case of data streams, where data elements flow continuously over time, forming 
         unbounded sequences of data. 
      </p>
      <p>In this context, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/rsp/">W3C <acronym title="RDF Stream Processing">RSP</acronym> Community 
         Group</a> has taken the task to explore the existing technical and theoretical proposals that incorporate streams to the RDF model, 
         and to its query language, SPARQL [[!SPARQL11-OVERVIEW]]. 
         More concretely, one of the main goals of the RSP Group is to  define a common but extensible core model for RDF stream processing. 
         It is not the intention of the RSP Group to propose a one-size fits-all model, which is probably infeasible anyway, but rather a 
         base common ground that can serve as a starting point for RSP engines to be able to talk to each other and interoperate.
      </p>
      <p>This document proposes a set of requirements for RDF stream processing, and design principles for an RDF Stream data model and query 
         language. 
         The remainder of the document is structured in three parts. First we state the key requirements for the RSP model in 
         <a href="#requirements">Section 2</a>. 
         Then we provide a proposal of design principles for a data model that extends RDF to support streams in <a href="#rspmodel">Section 3</a>. 
         <a href="#rspquery">Section 4</a> describes the design principles for the query feature extensions for SPARQL to comprehend the RDF 
         Stream model.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="requirements">      
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
     
      <p>Requirements for RDF stream processing summarized below are the result of the RSP Group on existing use cases [[RSP-USECASES]], as 
         well as the needs gathered in extensive existing works of the state of the art. Many of them are also valid for non-RDF systems 
         (e.g. see [[STONEBRAKER2005]]) while others come as the result of our individual or joint work on extending RDF for stream processing. 
         The requirements are stated at a high level, and we do not fully detail them as in the use cases. 
         The goal is rather to allow a reader to understand the challenges that RSP systems should be able to address. 
      </p>
      <section>
      <h3>Functional Requirements</h3>
        <section>
        <h4>Abstract Model</h4>

          <ol>
            <li>RDF streams should be representable in an abstract model, and the semantics of this abstract model 
              should provide the basis of the results of RSP queries.</li> 
            <li>The RDF stream abstract model should be serialized in concrete formats derived from standard formats, 
              extending beyond the standard format only when necessary.</li>
            <li>An RDF Stream should be identifiable with an 
                <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf11-concepts-20140225/#section-IRIs">IRI</a>.</li>
            <li>RDF streams may have timestamps based on different notions of time (time instants, intervals) with 
              different semantics (application, validity, transactional).</li> 
              In case no timestamp is associated to an RDF stream data item, the system is responsible of managing 
              time-based ordering of stream items.</li>
            <li>The RDF stream model should be susceptible to be restricted in order to facilitate implementation 
              and support efficient representation.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4>Query Language</h4>

          <ol>
            <li>RSP queries should support combining multiple RDF streams as well as stored RDF (aka static RDF graphs or datasets).</li>
            <li>RSP queries should support the minimal set of features identified in this document. </li>
            <li>The semantics of the RSP data and query model should allow generating predictable results, so that 
                correctness of the RSP query process can be evaluated.</li>
 <li>RSP queries should be able to access all knowledge explicitly expressed in the stream, including names 
              of named graphs and triples containing such names.</li>
 <li>RSP queries should be able to refer to the named graphs of streams.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>In addition to these general requirements, we define a set of mandatory features for RSPs that implement query processing, 
             and a set of optional features that they may support.</p>
          <section><h4>Mandatory Query Processing Features</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>RSPs should be able to query streaming data from one or several RDF streams</li>
              <li>RSPs should be able to query data from RDF graphs combined with RDF Streams</li>
              <li>RSPs should support <code>SELECT</code> and <code>CONSTRUCT</code> queries</li>
              <li>RSPs should support defining one or more time windows over an RDF Stream</li>
              <li>RSPs should support all SPARQL 1.1 [[!SPARQL11-Query]] operators</li>
              <li>RSPs should support nesting RSP queries</li>
            </ol>
          </section>
          <section><h4>Optional Query Processing Features</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>RSPs may support defining count-based windows over RDF streams</li>
              <li>RSPs may support <code>RSTREAM</code>, <code>ISTREAM</code> and <code>DSTREAM</code> operators (stream out query results)</li>
              <li>RSPs may support sequence operators (Pattern followed by another Pattern)</li>
              <li>RSPs may support the <code>WITHIN</code> operator (evaluate if a pattern occurs within an interval)</li>
              <li>RSPs may support combining sequence operators and window operators</li>
              <li>RSPs may support accessing the timestamp information of the RDF stream within the query</li>
            </ol>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4>RSP Engines</h4>

          <ol>
            <li>RSPs should be capable of processing streams of data reactively.</li>
            <!--<li>RSPs should process streams of data actively and in-stream, without the need of storing them. 
                Systems may optionally store or archive streams but an RSP should be able to process them applying 
                sequences of operations as they flow over time.</li>-->
            <li>RSP query engines should support a declarative query language derived from (and compatible with) SPARQL,

    <h2>RSP Data Model: Design Principles</h2>
    
      <p>The data model for representing RDF streams considers unbounded sequences of data items that flow over time. 
         More specifically, these data items are RDF triples, assembled in graphs, as an event or observation typically requires 
         more than one triple to be represented. 
         Each of these graphs in the sequence respects a particular order, given by time annotations which can be explicit or implicit. 
         The main considerations for this abstract model are detailed below, first describing the time model, and then the RDF stream model itself.
      </p>
 
      <section>
      <h3>Time in Stream Data Items</h3>
      
        <p>The notion of time in an RDF streams is important, as it establishes an order among the data items. 
           Time annotations (in some cases called timestamps), can be defined in a totally ordered domain with a distance metric. 
           Time can be represented as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Time as a point-in-time instant.</li>
          <li>Time as an interval (point in time is a special case of this).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A convenient time model in this context is the Time Ontology in OWL [[!OWL-TIME]], which defines <code>Instant</code> and 
           <code>Interval</code> as subclasses of <code>TemporalEntity</code>.
        </p>
        <p>Within the time model we do not specify mechanisms for dealing with delayed and out of order triples. </p>
      </section>
        
      <section>
      <h3>RDF Stream</h3>
        
        <p>An RDF stream is a sequence of RDF graphs including associated metadata, as a flexible mechanism to add time-related metadata. 
           The RSP group identified the following types of time metadata (although we do not exclude others):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>production time:</b> when the data item was produced.</li>
          <li><b>receiving time:</b> when the data item was made available to the RSP.</li>
          <li><b>start time</b>, <strong>end time</strong>: when the data item was valid, started and ended.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In many cases, the arrival order of the RDF graphs suffices as an “implicit timestamp” attached to each RDF graph. 
           In such cases the timestamp can be annotated as a <i>system timestamp</i>. In any case for the abstract model the RDF stream 
           elements appear to be timestamped, even if this is done at the system level on arrival of data items.
        </p>
        <p>An RDF stream processor may attach additional metadata, e.g. describing the time at which it received the data item. 
           Producers of RDF streams can attach the production time to the RDF graphs they stream. If the RDF graph represents information 
           with a validity interval, the producer can also attach metadata to describe the start and the end time of the validity interval. 
        </p>
 
        <p>An RDF stream should be defined under the following considerations:</p>
        <ul> 
          <li>An RDF Stream should be defined as a potentially unbounded sequence of time-annotated elements.</li>
          <li>The time annotation, or timestamp should be defined on a time domain, which we leave open for possible different types of 
              timestamps and intervals. One example domain is the discrete, linearly ordered and infinite set of time instants.</li>
          <li>Each RDF stream element should contain an RDF graph, which can be identified or not.</li>
          <li>Each RDF stream element should indicate a <dfn>timestamp predicate</dfn>, which establishes which is the RDF predicate 
              that the timestamp refers to. Examples of a timestamp predicate could include <code>prov:generatedAtTime</code> or 
              <code>ssn:observationSamplingTime</code>.</li>
          
          <li>Every RDF stream has a unique IRI identifier.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A key difference wrt previous RDF stream models is the support of streaming graphs instead of triples. 
           This allows to structure more complex events in a stream, as opposed to just plain triples. 
           For example, an observation typically requires several triples to be described (observed property, value, time, observer, etc). 
           Another example is related to the flexibility in timestamping (one vs. two times or application time vs. system time), which 
           is only possible if timestamps can be attached to an event structure. That cannot be achieved with flat triples. 
        </p>


        <p><b>Running Example:</b> In the following, we use the following example based in Social sensing: i.e. People detected in rooms 
           over time.
           URL of the stream: <code><http://example.org/streams/social></code>. Or <code>ex:social</code> if we set the prefix 
           <code>ex:</code> as <code>http://example.org/streams/</code>.
           Sample data on the stream:
        </p> 
        <pre class="example highlight" title="RDF Stream Example"><code>
:g1 {:axel :isIn :RedRoom. :darko :isIn :RedRoom} {:g1 prov:generatedAtTime t1}

:g3 {:minh :isIn :RedRoom. }                      {:g3 prov:generatedAtTime t3}
...
        </code></pre>

      <h3>Considerations</h3>
        <section>
        <h4>Punctuation</h4>
          <p>A punctuation is a pattern <code>p</code> inserted into the data stream with the meaning that no data 
             item <code>i</code> matching <code>p</code> will occur further on in the stream [[TUCKER2003]] [[MAIER2005]].
             For streams of RDF graphs this can be used like this: A punctuation is a pattern <code>p</code> 
             inserted into the graph stream with the meaning that no triples <code>i</code> from graph <code>p</code> 
             will occur further on in the stream. 
             In order to implement punctuation, special triples (ones that indicate punctuation, e.g. 
             <code><:g rsp:punctuate rsp:now></code>) could be employed. 
             However, as we use the Web stack(!) we can do punctuation out-of-band i.e. by doing punctuation on a lower 
             layer of the stack. For example we can communicate through chunked transfer encoding ([[RFC2616]], Section 3.6.1) 
             from HTTP 1.1 [[HTTP11]]. 
             Each chunk contains a complete graph and the receiver will know that after a chunk is received the event is 
             completely received and can be processed further in an atomic fashion. There is a guarantee that no triples 
             for this graph will arrive later. Using HTTP chunked connections no special (or magic) triples are needed.
          </p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
        <h4>Immutability and Event Derivation</h4>
          <p>In many event processing systems [[CUGOLA2012]], events are immutable [[LUCKHAM2011]]. 
             This stems from the definition of what an event is: An event is <i>"an occurrence within a particular system 
             or domain; it is something that has happened, or is contemplated as having happened"</i> [[ETZION2010]]. 
             So events cannot be made to unhappen.
          </p>

          <p class="note">
             Open Question: Does this apply to all systems/applications/usecases or just to many as stated above?
          </p>

          <p>Adopting immutability as a general assumption can be very useful for building systems, as it allows more control 
             over the correctness and predictability of the system, specially in a distributed environment and when consistency 
             is at stake in a concurrent processing setting. 
             But then, how can a Stream processing agent process events if they are immutable? Every processing task produces 
             new derived events as results, and as an advantage the underived events are still available for other uses and 
             remain immutable.
             For RSP this means: (1) create a new (unique) graph for the derived event (2) possibly link back to the base 
             event(s) thus enabling drill-down or root cause / provenance analysis of the derived event. The links can be made 
             with <code>DUL:hasConstituent</code> from DOLCE Ultralight [[DUL]], or with sub-properties such as in [[HARTH2011]].

    <h2>RDF Stream Query Language: Design Principles</h2>

      <p>RDF stream query processing languages have been proposed in the past, and some of the features described in this section
         have been presented in one or more of these languages. In this section we selected the most prominent query language features,
         which we consider would be essential or at least important in a standard RSP query language.
         When applicable, we compare with existing query languages, and if necessary, we propose new query constructs or combinations, if
         they were not supported in existing languages.
      </p>

      <section>
      <h3>Input</h3>
        <p>The input for an RSP query may include streams and stored data. In SPARQL, the query input is encapsulated on a dataset that 
           declares a default and named graphs. Based on this assumption, an RSP query is poet against an extended dataset, composed of 
           (potentially):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>One or more RDF streams </li>
          <li>One or more RDF graphs </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For stored RDF graphs, the declaration of named and unnamed graphs should follow the SPARQL specification of a dataset. For 
           declaring streams, a similar mechanism can be applied. 
           For example in C-SPARQL this has been achieved with a similar declaration with the <code>FROM</code> clause:
           <ul><li><code>FROM STREAM ex:social [… window spec …]</code></li></ul>
           As a consequence, windowed streams in this case are merged, so that the result can be accessed in the query body. 
           Alternatively, as in CQELS, streams can be accessed individually inside the query body, therefore not requiring a merge 
           previously:
           <ul><li><code>WHERE {STREAM ex:social [… window spec …] {  }</code></li></ul>
        </p>
        <p>The proposed approach should consider the declaration of streams (and window declarations), and the individual usage of
           windows inside the query body. We will analyze the window definitions later, but we already show how streams can be declared
           in the <code>FROM</code> clause, and thanks to a window identifier, they can be used in the query body:           
        </p>
        <pre class="example highlight" title="RSP-QL: Declaration of a window <code>:win</code> for the <code>ex:social</code> stream."><code>
FROM NAMED WINDOW :win ON ex:social [… window spec …] 
        </code></pre>



        <p>Notice that in a single query one may issue different windows for the same stream (e.g. with different window parameters,
           such as size or slide), on multiple streams, or combined with RDF graphs. The following example shows a declaration of multiple
           windows on several streams, combined with standard named graph declarations. We omit the window specifications, as they will be
           covered later on.</p>
       <pre class="example highlight" title="RSP-QL: Declaration of multiple windows for multiple streams."><code>

FROM NAMED :people  
        </code></pre>
      </section>  

      <section>
      <h3>Output</h3>
        <p>Depending on the Query form (e.g. <code>SELECT</code>, <code>CONSTRUCT</code>), the output can be of different form.
           Also, depending if the results are returned as a stream or as finite sets, the output is of different type. In summary,
           an RSP query answer could have the following types of output:  
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>Sets of bindings: If the query is a <code>SELECT</code> and the result is not streamed.</li>
         <li>Stream of bindings: If the query is a <code>SELECT</code> and the result is streamed.</li>
         <li>Sets of graphs: If the query is a <code>CONSTRUCT</code> and the result is not streamed.</li>
         <li>Stream of graphs: If the query is a <code>CONSTRUCT</code> and the result is streamed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">How are the timestamps of the graphs defined in the query results?</p>
        <p>Results of a query could be part of a subscription, allowing the query client to obtain results as soon as they are 
           available, or following subscription rules. These aspects are related to the architecture of a RSP engine, and are not 
           part of this document.

<!-- Overview ================================================================================== -->

      <section>
      <h3>RDF Stream Operators: Overview</h3>

        <p>Following the model as proposed in several previous works, we consider 3 main classes of operators over RDF streams 
           and RDF graphs (for more information refer also to [[SR4LD2014]]):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>S2R:</b> Stream to bounded RDF, which inherits the idea of stream-to-relation 
              operators in CQL which produce a relation from a stream.</li>
          <li><b>R2R:</b> Bounded RDF to RDF, which inherits the idea of relation-to-relation 
              operators in CQL which produce a relation from one or more other relations</li>
          <li><b>R2S:</b> Bounded RDF to Stream, which inherits the idea of relation-to-stream 
              operators in CQL which produce a stream from a relation</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>In addition to these operators, we may consider S2S operators that take and produce a stream (e.g. stream filtering).</p>

        <p>In these RSP operators the R denotes finite RDF graphs or mappings, as opposed to unbounded sequences of RDF graphs, 
           i.e. streams.
           In addition to those operators (which can be thought as part of a RSP Data Manipulation Language (DML) in SQL terms), 
           there is also the need for a Data Definition Language (DDL) to register a stream, register continuous queries, etc. 
           Of all known RSP languages, only C-SPARQL has DDL primitives, but they are limited to query registration, e.g. 
           <code>REGISTER (QUERY|STREAM) name AS</code>. 
        </p>
        <p>In the case of R2R operators, existing SPARQL 1.1 [[SPARQL11-Query]] operators are already covered by the SPARQL 
           specification and semantics, and should be  supported in an RSP query language (semantics for RDF streams may need 
           adaptations).
        </p>
      </section>

<!-- S2S ================================================================================== -->

      <section>
      <h3>S2S Operators</h3>
        <p>While S2S operators can be seen as a combination of S2R and R2S, it can be argued that for some tasks, e.g. stream 
           filtering or others, it is not necessarily desired that S2R operators must be used. Most window-based RSP systems do 
           not support this type of operations, and therefore it is not technically possible to define this type of queries in 
           these systems. Also, it can be argued that the lack of use of S2R operators in this scenario may lead to scalability 
           issues as the number of stream items to be considered is never limited.
           However, in caes where no joins nor aggregating are performed, e.g. simple graph pattern matching and filtering, when 
           past stream items can be forgotten, this type of query can be of use.
        </p>
        <section>
        <h4>SELECT</h4>
          <p>The projection is performed using the <code>SELECT</code> clause that includes the variable names in the query body 
             that are requested in the results. As mentioned before, existing window-based RSP languages can only operate over 
             windows and not directly on the streams.
             For instance, if we simply want to output who is in which room, following the previous example, this can be a achieved 
             in CQELS by setting up a time window with any (reasonably small) window size. In this case the window size does not 
             have any impact on the results, as in CQELS the output is thrown as soon as there is a match (also known as a content 
             change window policy). 
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="Query: Who is where? in CQELS:"><code>
SELECT ?room ?person
WHERE {
  STREAM ex:social [RANGE 1m]  {?person :isIn ?room}
}
          </code></pre>

          <p>In RSP-QL we could be able to omit the window specification altogether. 
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="Query: Who is where? in RSP-QL:"><code>
SELECT ?room ?person
FROM NAMED WINDOW :win ON ex:social
WHERE {
  WINDOW :win {?person :isIn ?room}
}
          </code></pre>
       
        </section>

        <section>  
        <h4>FILTER</h4>
          <p>The filter operator is a selection, as in standard SPARQL. In this case, as it is in the context of a S2S operation, it 
            follows the same considerations as the previous case. For illustrative purposes we show an example of how such type of query
            could be specified.
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="Query: Where is Axel at each moment? in RSP-QL"><code>
SELECT ?room
FROM NAMED WINDOW :win ON ex:social
WHERE {
  WINDOW :win {?person :isIn ?room. FILTER(?person = :axel) }
}          
// Or alternatively this filter can be done simply as a BGP:
SELECT ?room
FROM NAMED WINDOW :win ON ex:social
WHERE {
  WINDOW :win {:axel :isIn ?room.}
}          
           </code></pre>
         </section>
         <section>  
         <h4>Aggregations</h4>
          <p>Some aggregation functions can also be applied directly over the stream without as a S2S operation, e.g. 
             MAX, MIN, SUM, etc.
          </p>

        <section>
        <h4>Time based sliding window</h4>
          <p>A time-based sliding windows is defined by two parameters: the window size and the window slide. The size is specified in terms
            of a time duration (e.g. 1 minute, 30 seconds, 1.3 days, etc.) and indicates that the window content, at time <code>t</code> will 
            contain only those elements whose timestamps are greater than <code>t-size</code>. The slide parameter, specified as a time duration,
            indicates how often the window will be computed, or *slide* over time. 
          </p>
          <p class="note">Additional case: About supporting windows that are not terminated by the current time, e.g. something like a window

FROM STREAM ex:social [RANGE 10m SLIDE 1m]
WHERE { 
 :axel :isIn ?room
}
          </code></pre>
          <p>The same query can be specified in CQELS.</p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="CQELS:"><code>
SELECT ?room

}
          </code></pre>
      
          <p>The results will be different depending on the RSP Engine that is used. For example in C-SPARQL the evaluation of the window is 
            performed each time the window closes. In a different approach, CQELS does it when the window content needs to be changed, ie., 
            in the event of new update from incoming streams or the expiration of an item in a window. For a more detailed description of 
            these differences refer to [[DELLAGLIO2013]].
          </p>
          <p>In RSP-QL, this query would be written in a similar way, 
          <pre class="example highlight" title="RSP-QL:"><code>
SELECT ?room
FROM NAMED WINDOW :win ON ex:social [RANGE PT10M SLIDE PT01M]
WHERE {
  WINDOW :win { :axel :isIn ?room }
}
          </code></pre>
          <p>Notice that the window size and slide follow the [[ISO8601]] standard for specifying durations. As the window is declared at the 
            beginning of the query, and it has an identifier (<code>:win</code> in this example), it can be reused as many times as necessary 
            in the query body.
          </p>
        </section>  
          
        <section> 
        <h4>Time based tumbling window</h4>
          <p>This is a special case of the general sliding window, when the size of the slide is equal to the window length. For example: Give 
            me the room where Axel has been in the last 10 minutes, updating results every 10 minutes.
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="CQELS:"><code>
SELECT ?room
WHERE { 
  STREAM ex:social [RANGE 10m TUMBLING] {:axel :isIn ?room}
}
          </code></pre>
          <p class="note">In RSP-QL we can use this syntax sugar or even omit the slide and default it to a tumbling window on that case.</p>
        </section>  
       
        <section>
        <h4>Triple based windows</h4>
          <p>In principle, triple-based windows were defined to emulate tuple count windows in CQL-like data stream systems. For example this 
            query returns the last 5 entries of a price stream in CQL:</p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="CQL tuple count window"><code>
Select P.price From Prices[Rows 5] as P
          </code></pre>
          <p>For our example, we can get the last 3 people detected in the stream with the following C-SPARQL query.</p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="C-SPARQL tripe window"><code>
REGISTER QUERY Track3latest AS
SELECT ?who 
FROM STREAM ex:social [RANGE TRIPLES 3]
WHERE {
 ?who :isIn ?room
}
          </code></pre>
          <p>In this example it works because each triple in the stream is an event on itself. However, in the general case one event requires 
            several triples in the stream to be fully described. For example consider a stream containing observations as the following:
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="Observation"><code>
:obs1 a ssn:Observation;
      ssn:observedBy :sensor1;
      ssn:observedProperty :peopleInRoom;
      ssn:observedValue :axel;
      dul:locatedIn :redRoom.
          </code></pre>      
          <p>If we ask for the latest 3 triples in the stream, we will not obtain the latest 3 observations, but only 3 triples, each one with 
            incomplete information. For this reason, C-SPARQL triple-based windows are not always useful, although they work as specified. 
            Other languages such as SPARQLStream do not include support for this altogether, as it has a demonstrated faulty behavior.
            In the RSP model discussed in this W3C Community Group, as we allow representing RDF streams as sequences of graphs, rather than 
            just triples, it should be possible to redefine this operator, with cleaner semantics.
          </p>

        <h4>Count-based window based on Basic Graph Pattern</h4> 
          <p>This <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#BasicGraphPatterns">BGP</a> count-based window is introduced to overcome the 
            above limitation of triple-based window on RDF streams defined as sequences of graphs. Instead of counting single triples, this 
            count-based window will count the groups of triples(subgraphs) that match a certain  basic graph pattern. 
            For example, the above pattern can be used to query last 3 observations (filter by <code>observedValue :axel</code>) as events 
            composed from a set of triples.
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="RSP-QL"><code>
SELECT ?obs ?room 
FROM NAMED WINDOW :win ON ex:social [RANGE BGP 3]
WHERE {
 ?obs a ssn:Observation;
      ssn:observedBy ?sensor;
      ssn:observedProperty :peopleInRoom;
      ssn:observedValue :axel;
      due:locatedIn ?room.
}
          </code></pre>
          <p class="note">The keyword TRIPLES above can be used instead BGP as it also cover above triple window.</p>

        <h4>Partitioned Windows (not supported)</h4>
          <p>Deal with one input stream and several output streams (i.e. the partitions), on which the query is evaluated.
            Based on knowing the schema, and deciding how to do the partition in a way that simplifies the query. This makes it complicated 
            for RSP. Example queries (partitioned): In the examples below, we can partition the input stream by dividing it by people's name 
            and then evaluate the query. (i) Find for each person the time spent until she leaves a room and enters another (time spent in 
            a room). (ii) Find for each person the time elapsed between a person leaves room A and enters room B, independently of how many 
            rooms are traversed in between (transition time).
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h4>Predicate-based window (not supported)</h4>
          <p>In Predicate-based windows, objects are qualified to be part of the window once they satisfy a certain query predicate. Similarly, 
            objects are expired only when they no longer satisfy a certain predicate. Predicate-based windows are a generalization of time-based 
            and tuple-count sliding windows, and it needs some sort of caching mechanisms to be implemented.
          </p>
          <p>Example queries: For each person, continuously report the elapsed time between each two consecutive readings. Only the latest 
            reading of each person needs to be considered. Once the reading of a person is reported, the previous reading expires. In C-SPARQL 
            we could in principle simulate predicate-based windows by using a network of queries.
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="C-SPARQL"><code>
REGISTER STREAM :s1 AS
CONSTRUCT { :s1 :matches ?who } 
FROM STREAM ex:social [RANGE ? STEP ?]
WHERE {
 ?who :isIn ?room
}

REGISTER QUERY :s2 AS
SELECT ?who 
FROM STREAM :s1 [RANGE 3 TRIPLES]
WHERE {
 :s1 :matches ?who
}
          </code></pre>
          <p class="note">It is a first sketch and it may not work as the CQELS one.</p>
          <p>In the general case, CQELS also needs nested  queries to present such queries. however, in CQELS, there is a syntax for specifying 
            last mappings that matched a certain basic graph pattern (using the BGP keyword). For example the query that gets last 3 person in 
            the room can be represented as following query.
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="CQELS"><code>

<!-- R2R ================================================================================== -->

      <section>
      <h3>R2R Operators</h3>
        <p>The R2R operators are inherited by SPARQL and they should follow the semantics of [[SPARQL11-Query]]. We do not describe them all in
          this section but we focus on some of the main ones, especially if there are specific details of interest for the RSP community.
        </p>

        <section>
        <h4>SELECT</h4>
          <p>We take again the query that returns the rooms and persons every minute. 
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="RSP-QL"><code>
SELECT ?room ?person
FROM NAMED WINDOW :win ON ex:social [RANGE PT1M SLIDE PT1M]

  WINDOW :win { ?person :isIn ?room }
}   
          </code></pre>   
        </section>

        <section>  
        <h4>GROUPBY</h4>
          <p>Aggregates are important operators in RSP, and again we follow the SPARQL 1.1 aggregate semantics. The following example query 
            illustrates its use: Find person who has been to more than 5 different rooms during the past 5 minutes:
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="C-SPARQL"><code>
REGISTER QUERY FastAndFurious AS

          <pre class="example highlight" title="RSP-QL"><code>

}
GROUPBY ?person
HAVING  (?rooms >= 5)
          </code></pre>
          <p>In a similar way, other aggregates such as SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX can also be supported.</p>
        </section>
 
        <section>  
        <h4>CONSTRUCT</h4>
          <p>The construct query allows to create new graphs based on que query bindings as in SPARQL 1.1. As an example query consider the
            following: Detect two different people in the same room for at least three seconds and create a graph of co-presence. 
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="CQELS"><code>
CONSTRUCT {?p1 :isWith ?p2}
WHERE {
  STREAM <s1> [RANGE 3s SLIDE 1s]
  { ?p1 isIn ?room. ?p2 isIn ?room. FILTER(?p1!=?p2)}
}
          </code></pre>

          <p>An RSP-QL query would follow a similar approach:
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="RSP-QL"><code>
CONSTRUCT {?p1 :isWith ?p2}
FROM NAMED WINDOW :win ON ex:social [RANGE PT3S SLIDE PT1S]
WHERE {
  WINDOW :win { ?p1 isIn ?room. ?p2 isIn ?room. FILTER(?p1!=?p2)}
}
          </code></pre>
          <p>However, this query does not ensure that both people are present in the window for the entire 3 seconds. In EP-SPARQL, there is
            a getDURATION() function that could be used for this type of query: 
          </p>

          <pre class="example highlight" title="EP-SPARQL"><code>
CONSTRUCT {?p1 :isWith ?p2 .}
WHERE     {STREAM <s1> { ?p1 isIn ?room. } AND {?p2 isIn ?room. }}
FILTER    (?p1!=?p2 && getDURATION() < "PT3S"^^xsd:duration)
          </code></pre>
        </section>  
        
        <section>
        <h4>OPTIONAL</h4>
          <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#optionals">Optional</a> pattern matching provides the following feature: "if the 
            optional part does not match, it creates no bindings but does not eliminate the solution" [[SPARQL11-Query]].
            As an example consider que following query: detect persons who has entered either room1 or room2 in the past 5 min. 
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="C-SPARQL"><code>
REGISTER QUERY OptionalQuery AS
SELECT ?person1 ?person2
FROM STREAM <S1> [RANGE 5m TUMBLING] 
WHERE {

    OPTIONAL {?person2 :isIn :room2} 
    FILTER(bound(?person1) || bound(?person2))
}
          </code></pre>
          <p>In CQELS this is not supported, but it could work in two ways: first as in the previous example: 
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="CQELS version1"><code>
SELECT ?person1 ?person2
WHERE {

    OPTIONAL {?person2 :isIn :room2} 
    FILTER(bound(?person1) || bound(?person2))
}}
          </code></pre>
          <p>Alternatively, using two individual sensor streams for room1 and room2 as follows, suing bound filters.</p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="CQELS version2"><code>
SELECT ?person1 ?person2
WHERE { 
   OPTIONAL { STREAM<S1> [RANGE 5M] {?person1 :isIn :room1}} 
   OPTIONAL { STREAM<S2> [RANGE 5M] {?person2 :isIn :room2}} 
   FILTER(bound(?person1) || bound(?person2))
}
          </code></pre>

        </section>  

        <section>
        <h4>FILTER MINUS</h4>
          <p>While the support of this operator is uneven in RSP engines, it is important for use cases where certain a certain type of negation 
            is needed. More specifically, it "calculates solutions in the left-hand side that are not compatible with the solutions on the 
            right-hand side" [[SPARQL11-Query]].
            As an example, consider the following query: detect persons who entered room1 without a doctorate during the past 5 minutes.
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="C-SPARQL (should be supported)"><code>

  { { ?person :isIn :room1 }
    FILTER MINUS 
    {GRAPH <profile> {?person :hasDegree :doctorate}
  }
}
          </code></pre>
          <p class="note">It may parse, but it may not give correct results. The problem is that all triples from the windows are merged in

          </p>

<!-- R2S ================================================================================== -->


      <section>
      <h3>R2S Operators</h3>
        <p>R2S operators produce a stream out of bounded RDF mappings. This operator is typically used as an output operator, producing a 
          stream after the R2R and S2R operators have been applied. Of the existing RSP engines, only SPARQLStream has provided an 
          implementation for these operators, namely:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>ISTREAM: only the data that was not in the previous window is added to the output stream.</li>
          <li>DSTREAM: only the data that was in the previous windows but not in the new one is streamed.</li>
          <li>RSTREAM: all data is added to the stream.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="example highlight" title="SPARQL-Stream"><code>
SELECT ISTREAM ?room ?person
FROM NAMED STREAM ex:social [1 MINUTES SLIDE 1 MINUTES] 
WHERE {
 ?person :isIn ?room .
}
        </code></pre>


        <p>In this case the room and person will be output only if they were not in the previous window. Notice that implicitly, C-SPARQL 
          always RSTREAMs results, and CQELS always ISTREAMs results, but do not allow for customizing the behavior, as reported 
          in [[DELLAGLIO2013]]. In RSP-QL this should be explicit, as in SPARQL-Stream:
        </p>
    
        <pre class="example highlight" title="SPARQL-Stream ISTREAM"><code>
SELECT ISTREAM ?room ?person
FROM NAMED WINDOW :win ON ex:social [RANGE PT1M SLIDE PT1M]
WHERE {
 WINDOW :win {?person :isIn ?room }
}
        </code></pre>
      </section>
    </section>


<!-- Time Ops ================================================================================== -->


      <section>
      <h3>Time-aware Operators</h3>
        <p>These operators come from the Complex Event Processing community, especially those that exploit temporal relationships between
          events or stream elements. While these operators have been studied in RSP in works such as EP-SPARQL, it is still subject of
          research, especially when combining with window-based approaches. Nevertheless, we present some of the most relevant operators
          of this kind, and how they could potentially be integrated with an RSP query language.
        </p>
        <section>
        <h4>SEQ</h4>
          <p>The sequence operator (SEQ) specifies that the left hand event expression must be matched, and then the right hand event 
            expression is  evaluated. This type of expression is useful to find out when some event is followed by another event.
            As an example query, consider the following: Provide pairs of rooms, e.g. (room1, room2), where Axel and Darko have been together 
            such that they are first in a room and then following each other in another room within 5 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>In C-SPARQL this type of query is partially supported, through the <code>timestamp</code> function that returns the timestamp
            of a triple pattern. By comparing these timestamps, the result can be obtained, although the query results a bit cumbersome.
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="C-SPARQL"><code>
REGISTER QUERY Seqence AS
SELECT DISTINCT ?room_x ?room_y

 :axel :isIn ?room_x. 
 :darko :isIn ?room_x. 
 :axel :isIn ?room_y. 
 :darko :isIn ?room_y.
 FILTER (timestamp(:axel :isIn ?room_x) = timestamp(:darko :isIn ?room_x) && 
         timestamp(:axel :isIn ?room_y) = timestamp(:darko :isIn ?room_y) &&  
         timestamp(:axel :isIn ?room_x) < timestamp(:darko :isIn ?room_y) 
         )
} 
          </code></pre>
          <p class="note">It may not be reactive</p>
          <p>In CQELS this is not supported although it has been planned in a hybrid CQELS-CEP version as follows:</p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="CQELS (not currently supported)"><code>
SELECT DISTINCT ?room_x ?room_y
WHERE { 
GRAPH <http://deri.org/floorplan/>  { ?room_x lv:sameLevelWith ?room_y.}
STREAM <http://deri.org/streams/S1> [RANGE 5m]{
  {:axel :isIn ?room_x. :darko :isIn ?room_x.} SEQ 
  {:axel :isIn ?room_y. :darko :isIn ?room_y.}
} 
          </code></pre>

          <p>EP-SPARQL has a native way of expressing the SEQ operator, providing a much simpler query, as shown in the following example.
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="EP-SPARQL"><code>
SELECT DISTINCT ?room_x ?room_y
WHERE { 
 {:axel :isIn ?room_x. :darko :isIn ?room_x.}  
SEQ
 {:axel :isIn ?room_y. :darko :isIn ?room_y.}}
 FILTER (getDURATION() < "PT5M"^^xsd:duration)
          </code></pre>

          <p>Alternatively, if the requirement is that Axel and Darko remain in room_x exactly the same time (and so in room_y), then the 
            query would look like the following one:
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="EP-SPARQL"><code>
SELECT DISTINCT ?room_x ?room_y
WHERE  {STREAM <s1> 
       { :axel :isIn ?room_x. }
EQUALS
       { :darko :isIn ?room_x.}
SEQ
       { :axel :isIn ?room_y. }
EQUALS
       { :darko :isIn ?room_y.}
}
FILTER (getDURATION() < " PT5M"^^xsd:duration)
          </code></pre>
        </section>  


        <section>
        <h4>REPETITION</h4>
          <p>The repetition in CEP matches repeating events over time. For example consider the following query: Find at least 3 different 
            pairs of rooms, in which Axel and Darko have been together within 10 minutes, moving from room_x to room_y. This query relies 
            on a SEQ operator and on counting the repetition of such sequence. Again, as the SEQ is not supported in RSPs as C-SPARQL, it
            has to be worked around as follows,using an aggregation count:
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="C-SPARQL"><code>
REGISTER QUERY Q7 AS
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT *) AS ?nroom

 :axel :isIn ?room_x. 
 :darko :isIn ?room_x. 
 :axel :isIn ?room_y. 
 :darko :isIn ?room_y.
 FILTER (timestamp(:axel :isIn ?room_x) = timestamp(:darko :isIn ?room_x) && 
         timestamp(:axel :isIn ?room_y) = timestamp(:darko :isIn ?room_y) &&  
         timestamp(:axel :isIn ?room_x) < timestamp(:darko :isIn ?room_y) 
         )
} 
HAVING (?nroom >3) 

          </code></pre>


          <p>Since ESPER has a native way of expressing the SEQ operator, this query might result easier if expressed in ESPER.
            This has been tried in ESPER (for illustrative purposes), using a simplistic TripleEvent object. Notice the use of 
            the every xx -> pattern in the Esper query. For more information and the code leading to this query refer to 
            [[KIAESPER]]. The query is expected to find at least 3 different pairs of rooms, in which Person-a and Person-b have 
            been together within 10 minutes, moving from room_a to room_b.
            This query relies on a SEQ operator and on counting the repetition of such sequence.

where a.subject!=b.subject and a.object=b.object and 
      c.subject!=d.subject and c.object=d.object and

      <h3>Other Operators</h3>
        <p>For completeness, we also include other operators that may result useful in specific use cases. They are of particular interest,
          especially considering that many use cases require integration with stored data, and even temporally valid stored data.
        <section>
        <h4>Refreshing stored data</h4>
          <p>Combining streaming and stored data is supported in existing RSP engines. However, in many cases the stored data can change during
            the query lifetime, so it might be important to refresh or update the stored contents at certain point of the evaluation process timeline. 
            An RSP should consider that different elements in background data change over time at different rates, 
            e.g., the twitter followers of a famous person changes more often than those of a regular one. 
            Also, rate of changes may vary  over  time, i.e. dynamic change rates [[DEHGHANZADEH2015]].
            Existing RSP languages do not impose or propose any way of explicitly performing these updates. In fact, in some RSP engines the stored 
            data is assumed to be static during query evaluation.
            An extension to the core functionality of the query language would be for the user to be able to provide hints as to how often the stored 
            data is updated. These may be interpreted by the query processing engine to indicate how often to refresh the stored data. We will need 
            to think about the granularity of these hints, e.g. by dataset, class, etc. An example of this, implemented as a query operator, can be 
            found in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/snee">SNEEql</a>, using the RESCAN keyword:
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="RESCAN in SNEEql"><code>
SELECT * FROM locations[RESCAN 20 SECONDS];
          </code></pre>

          <p>Although SPARQLStream has been used to rewrite to SNEEql, the RESCAN operator has not been mapped to an equivalent in SPARQLStream.</p>
        </section>
  
        <section>
        <h4>Fact</h4>
          <p>Fact is a Complex Event Processing operator, which maintains temporal states (the Facts) of a system.
            It differentiates: Events, i.e. things that happen(ed) and Facts, i.e. things that are true for a specified amount of time. A more detailed 
            description can be found at TEF-SPARQL [[GAO2015]].
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="Assuming the following example:"><code>
Axel enter RoomA, [2]
Darko enter RoomA, [3]
Axel leave RoomA, [6]
Axel enter RoomB, [6]
Darko leave RoomA, [8]
Darko enter RoomB, [8]
          </code></pre>
          <p>Each data entry in this stream is an Event: The event “Axel enter RoomA at time 2” is always true, as it actually happened. The Fact that 
            “Axel isIn RoomA” is a temporal state in the system, which is only true for a restricted period of time. Axel is in roomA, only SINCE time 2, 
            UNTIL he leaves the room at time 6.
            The FACT operator maintains such temporal states, together with operations such as SINCE (set the beginning time of a valid fact) and TILL 
            (set the ending time of a fact).
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="The example in TEF-SPARQL [6] syntax"><code>
CONSTRUCT FACT UserFact  {?user isIn ?room}
(UNION 
         (SINCE   ?user :enter ?room)
         (TILL  ?user :leave ?room) 
)
          </code></pre>

          <p>The benefits of using Fact operator:
          <ul>
            <li>It simplifies stream reasoning by creating/updating Facts.</li>
            <li>It saves the cost of maintaining events between consecutive time windows.</li>
          </p>
          <p>Query: Give the current number of people in each room, every 3 seconds.</p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="TEF-SPARQL"><code>
// creating facts
CONSTRUCT FACT UserFact  {?user isIn ?room}
(UNION 
         (SINCE   ?user :enter ?room)
         (TILL  ?user :leave ?room) 
) 
// counting facts 
SELECT ?room AS ROOM, ?user as USER (AGGREGATE ? room, COUNT ?user
         WHERE (CURRENT ?user isIn ? room)
         GROUP BY ? room
         EVERY  "P3SEC"^^xsd:Duration) 
          </code></pre>
          <p>We can store and count the number of Facts (e.g., <Axel isIn RoomA, startTime, endTime>). The Facts can be created by “SINCE” clause (when <Axel enter RoomA> arrives, the fact is created with empty “endTime”. ) and terminated by “TILL” clause (when <Axel leave RoomA> arrives, the fact is terminated by updating “endTime”. )</p>

          <p>Esper with fact
We use the operator "Named window" in ESPER to manage Facts.</p>

          <pre class="example highlight" title="ESPER"><code>
create window factUser.win:keepall() as (userName String, room String, startTime Long, endTime Long)
// create facts
on UserEvent merge factUser where factUser.room = UserEvent.room and factUser.userName = UserEvent.userName
when matched  and UserEvent.userAction = '<leave>'  
// update the ending time of the fact, and delete
then delete where factUser.userName = UserEvent.userName  
when not matched
// insert a fact with an opening end time
then insert  
select UserEvent.userName as userName, UserEvent.userRoom as room, UserEvent.timeStamp as startTime, 0L as endTime    
    
// counting the facts
select count(*), room from factUser group by room output all every 3 sec
          </code></pre>

          <p>SPARQL without Fact
Without Fact operator, the system needs to create an additional stream to maintain system states. In this example, UseRoomCounts stream is created for two kinds of counting events of each room: enterCount and leftCount.</p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="C-SPARQL"><code>
REGISTER STREAM UserEnterLeftCounts AS
CONSTRUCT { ?room uc:enterCount ?enterCount ; uc:leftCount ?leftCount . }
FROM STREAM <http://…/fb> [RANGE 3 sec TUMBLING]
WHERE {
          { SELECT ( COUNT(?userEnter) as ?enterCount ) ?room
                    WHERE { ?userEnter enter ?room } GROUP BY ?room }
          { SELECT ( COUNT(?userLeft) as ?leftCount ) ?room
                    WHERE { ?userLeft left ?room } GROUP BY ?room } }

REGISTER STREAM UseRoomCounts AS
CONSTRUCT {?room uc:currentCount ?newCount }
FROM STREAM <http://…/fb> [RANGE 3 sec TUMBLING]
WHERE {
          { SELECT ( ?currentCount + ?enterCount - ?leftCount as ?newCount ) ?room
                    WHERE {?room uc:enterCount ?enterCount ; uc:leftCount ?leftCount ; uc:currentCount ?currentCount . } } }

          </code></pre>


          <p>Esper without Fact
Without using "named window" operator, the system needs to copy the count events (Part 2 in blow) between windows, in order to maintain the count events.
create schema countEventType (timeStamp Long , userCount Long, room String)</p>
          <pre class="example highlight" title="Esper"><code>
// part1: create count events
insert into countEventType 
select  
           (select count(*)  
           from UserEvent.win:time_batch( 3 sec)  as ue 
           where ce.userRoom = ue.userRoom and ue.userAction = '<leave>'  ) 
           (select count(*)  
           from UserEvent.win:time_batch( 3 sec) as ue 
           where ce.userRoom = ue.userRoom and ue.userAction = '<enter>' ) 
as userCount , ce.userRoom as room ,  (current_timestamp + 3000L) as timeStamp 
from UserEvent.win:time_batch( 3 sec) as ce
group by ce.userRoom  

// part2:  copy count events between each window
insert into countEventType 
select sum(userCount) as userCount, room as room , (current_timestamp + 3000L) as timeStamp 
from countEventType.win:time_batch( 3 sec) group by room  
    
// part3:  aggregate count events
select sum(userCount) as counter, ce.room as room, current_timestamp as currentTime, ce.room 
from countEventType.win:time_batch( 3 sec) as ce 
group by ce.room  
          </code></pre>

          <p>If there are multiple streams involved, the cost of maintaining events could be potentially very high. Facts provide a solution for modelling and maintaining temporal states.</p>

    <h2>Serialisation</h2>
      <p>The abstract model can be implemented in different concrete formats or serialisations. The question is, how can the model be serialised? Following our requirements, we shall attempt to remain as compatible as possible with existing RDF serialisations. In general, the RDF Stream data model is defined independently of the various possible serialisations.</p>
      <p>The W3C RSP Group has started to address this sub-topic in a dedicated thread. This initiative already explored the current format standards for RDF, including RDF/XML, Turtle, N-Quads, N-Triples, JSON-LD and TriG. The binary representations that exist have also been explored, including HDT, SHDT, ERI, RDSZ and EXI. The evaluation and analysis of serialisation formats will continue during the Group life span, and final results go beyond the scope of this document.</p>
